0.3.6 - 2019/01/07
==================

- Add max_memory and mem_reclaim_time options on configuration, still to be implemented.


0.3.5 - 2019/01/06
==================

- Client connections are now stored in a hashtable instead of a linked list


0.3.4 - 2019/01/02
==================

- Add KEYS command, a naive implementation


0.3.3 - 2019/01/01
==================

- Fixed bad-malloc_usable_size issue and re-implemented memory tracking
- Fixed size of the trie update on prefix delete operation


0.3.2 - 2018/12/31
==================

- Add prefix command handling to PUT, but sanitizers report an issue
  bad-malloc_usable_size
- Add vector structure, for further improvements on lookup-heavy parts of the
  program


0.3.1 - 2018/12/30
==================

- Refactored trie structure in order to reduce the homongous memory
  requirements it demanded, while not decreasing that much the performance
- Added INC and DEC support for prefix range query


0.2.4 - 2018/12/28
==================

- Add prefix command handling to INC and DEC commands, now they can be applied
  in a glob matching key


0.2.3 - 2018/12/28
==================

- Add basic configuration handling
- Add COUNT command, prefix command, return the number of keys matching a given
  prefix
- Fixed bug in insertion causing memory leaks while updating keys


0.2.0 - 2018/12/27
==================

- Refactored binary protocol design and implementation
- Started abstraction over EPOLL to create a more flexible event loop


0.1.5 - 2018/12/24
==================

- Add custom memory management to track memory usage
- Add array of keys to DEL command to delete set of keys at once
- Fixed a moltitude of bugs, so now there's only a moltitude of bugs remaining


0.1.0 - 2018/12/09
==================

- Add single thread EPOLL server, refined protocol


0.0.1 - 2018/12/08
==================

- First commit, implemented basic trie data structure.
